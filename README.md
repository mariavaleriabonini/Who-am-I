# ✨  What could I offer? ✨ 


- 2+ years of experience with BI Tools: I make maginc with  **QlikSense** e **PowerBI** (no rabbits out of hats 🎩, only dashboard).
- Knowledge of **ETL tools**: as one famous singer once sang, 'I want to find meaning in this data, even if this data doesn't make sense,' but it will.
- Ability to **communicate directly with clients**: I talk to clients like they're old friends, even if that old friend is explaining something incomprehensible, we'll figure it out.
- 📈**Requirements gathering**, **project management**, **development**, and **delivery**, complete with **training for the end user**, so they can have fun tweaking everything I’ve spent hours creating.
- Aesthetic sense: we use BI for what it was created for (though I see you, I see you wanting nothing more than a simple Excel export in the end).
- ✍️ Ability to leave **clear documentation of the procedures used**, to help you, the clients, and myself when I come back from vacation barely remembering where I am.
- **Experience in consulting firms**: we all know what that means—lots of projects in lots of fields. Fashion, automotive, ceramics, healthcare. I know many technical terms specific to each sector, enough to seem knowledgeable even when I'm not.
- **Teamwork skills**, though if you see me with my headphones on, you need to give me some space.
- **Energy**, **proactivity**, and **adaptability**: I know, these terms are overused, partly I needed them to please LinkedIn's algorithm, but they’re also true.
- **Everything else that’s on my resume**: I don’t want to spoil the surprise, you can find it on my profile. Or you can message me and I’ll send it to you. Or we can schedule a call, and I'll tell you about it. It’s all the same, your choice.

# 🔎  What I would like to find? 🔍

- **Challenges and growth opportunities**: at 25, I bring a balance of curiosity and ambition, making me highly adaptable and open to learning, use this opportunity.
- **Dynamism and openness to remote work**: I can brainstorm just as well in the office as on the couch (slippers included), with the difference that at least at home I can keep my cat company, and Greta Thunberg will be happy that I’m not using the car.
- **Education**, **respect**, and **honesty**: No drama, just common sense, mutual respect, and peaceful breaks.
- **Informal environment**,: Don’t worry, no Birkenstocks in the office. On video calls, I’ll always have a clean shirt, and when I travel, I’ll wear pants that aren’t pajamas.
- **Well-defined roles**: There’s no point in having a six-tier responsibility tree if it gets ignored. I have my role, I’ll respect it and collaborate with the team members, but everyone stays in their own seat.
